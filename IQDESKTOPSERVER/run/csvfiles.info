Pretty straight forward - care needs to be taken with the following:

[VNC certificate and key]
- Stored in variables: VNC_PRIVATE_KEY=... and VNC_PRIVATE_KEY=... as is.
- Cert files are taken "as-is" with following modifications:
    \n => ::: 
  this allows to code the key and cert in single lines.
  IMPORTANT: the string has to be quoted in the CSV file. 
  => When using excel this might need to be done manually afterwards - or in excel directly.
  => Better: not providing VNC cert and key in the CSV files but via the server.

[MONOLIX License File]
- Stored in variable: MONOLIX_LICENSE_KEY=...
- Only license file can be provided here! Activation key not!
- License file is taken "as-is" with following modifications:
    \n => ::: and " => &&& 
  this allows to code the file in a single line.
